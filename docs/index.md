## About

<tt>linebyline</tt> is a public python package for conducting high-precision radial velocity (RV) analysis, using the "line-by-line" technique of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...620A..47D/abstract" target="_blank">Dumusque (2018)</a> and Siegel et al. 2022. 

This package is a complete RV analysis pipeline, with the ability to process a series of 1D spectra and return corresponding line-by-line radial velocity measurements and stellar activity indices.

Currently, HARPS, HARPS-N, NEID, and MAROON-X are supported instruments.

## Installation

To install, download the package, change directories into the downloaded folder, and run:

	pip install .
